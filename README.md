# Strategy Game
This is a very simple game based on both Rampart and Galaga. You fight waves of increasingly difficult enemies that swarm towards your castle, the green square at the center.  
Every few seconds, you get a chance to change the goal position and angle of your "fighters". Click them in the head and click anywhere else to choose the position they move to; move your mouse (the red bar gives you a hint) until the angle is desirable and click again to set that angle. Then the fighters will move towards it and whatnot. They shoot bullets constantly that kill enemy ships.

That's the hard bit. I'm not going to detail scoring and other such things; these are for you to figure out.
