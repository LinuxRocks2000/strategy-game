                <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                    Under the hood, the MMOSG server is written in Rust with <a href="https://docs.rs/warp/latest/warp/">Warp</a> and <a href="https://tokio.rs/">Tokio</a>.
                    There is an older version written in C++ that is kept, but deprecated - it used <a href="https://crowcpp.org/master/">CrowCPP</a>. I opted to move to Rust with Warp
                    after I realized there was a memory bug in over 1500 lines of C++. The rewrite is far better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are several official clients for MMOSG, and this documentation means to facilitate unofficial modding.
                    The most popular client is the default one built into most MMOSG servers; the newest and most optimized (as
                    well as cleanest) one is usually available on the /mod endpoint of most mmosg servers. This documentation is largely aimed at
                    further client development, including a currently in-progress Wii fork.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This documentation is primarily focused on client design - while it is technically possible to create a server based on the information included here,
                    it's not supported. The server is much more complicated, and I will probably have to write a separate doc sheet for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The source code is hosted alongside the old single player Strategy Game on <a href="https://github.com/LinuxRocks2000/strategy-game">Github</a>.
                </p>
                <h1 id="protocol">MMOSG Protocol</h1>
                <p>
                    The protocol is fairly simple, designed for small frame sizes and extensibility. It is geared to support Unicode,
                    resist injection attacks, and serialize/deserialize simple data structures very fast.
                    It runs over the WebSocket application-level protocol, allowing universality - WebSocket is supported just about everywhere:
                    most notably in JavaScript on the web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: Capitalization is important! If you get "T" and "t" mixed up, clients will probably
                    wonder why there's a tie game 30 times a second and the board only updates once after everyone leaves.
                </p>
                <h2 id="protocol+framestructure">Frame Structure</h2>
                <p>
                    Each MMOSG frame <i>must</i> come with its own WebSocket frame. Multiple messages cannot be fit in a single frame -
                    this keeps code simple and allows very fast variable argument lists. Each frame begins with a UTF-8 cleartext character signifying the operation,
                    then a list of arguments (UTF-8 compatible strings). Each argument is begun with a UTF-8 character which must be decoded as a number;
                    this is the number of UTF-8 characters in the argument. This wastes one byte only as opposed to character delimination, and character
                    delimination allows accidental injection attacks (this was a common bug in the old version!). Both client and server use this format, but the
                    operation codes for client-to-server and server-to-client are very different! An example server-to-client message is
                    <span class="frame">
                        <span>M</span>
                        <span>&lt;2&gt;</span>
                        <span>28</span>
                        <span>&lt;3&gt;</span>
                        <span>567</span>
                        <span>&lt;3&gt;</span>
                        <span>345</span>
                    </span>
                    - operation M, first arg length 2, first arg "28", second arg length 3, second arg "567", third arg length 3, third arg length "345".
                    Note that the argument lengths would be encoded as UTF-8 characters, which are shown as a decimal representation with angle brackets
                    because those characters are non-printing. M frames are quite complex (they have many optional arguments), but the first 3 (required)
                    arguments are simple - id, x, y. This is telling the client that object #28 moved to (567, 345) on the gameboard. More about IDs later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Number arguments are expected to be serialized in base-10</b>.
                </p>
                <h2 id="protocol+hello">Aside: HELLO</h2>
                <p>
                    The only messages that do not conform to the spec above are "HELLO MMOSG" and "HELLO CLIENT". It is completely optional, but if clients
                    wish to ensure that they are connecting to an MMOSG server and not some other application, they may send "HELLO MMOSG". If the response is
                    anything other than "HELLO CLIENT" (or they don't receive a response within ~500ms), they can be fairly certain that they are not connecting
                    to an MMOSG server. The latency cap for HELLO messages is not enforced; it can be as high as you want. You may also use ping/pong for the
                    same purpose.
                </p>
                <h2 id="protocol+pingpong">Ping/Pong</h2>
                <p>
                    MMOSG implements ping/pong as a keep-alive mechanism and to keep clients aware of their online/offline state.
                    Pings and pongs follow the standard message format, but have 0 args - they're merely a single character, "_".
                    When the server receives "_" from any client, it will respond with "_" as soon as possible. This will keep the
                    TCP stream alive in moments of inactivity (waiting for game start). You should use any messages from the server
                    at all as a disclaimer that the client is online, but sending pings every 100-500ms is a good practice no matter
                    what. To avoid server lag, you should not send ping/pongs more often than once every 100ms. Clients aren't
                    required to ping - if you have another way to keep the stream alive, you can use that instead.

                        Deduct cost from your score. This is used for things like extra walls and RTF upgrades, where payment is handled by
                        the client code
                        instead of the server code. This opens the doors for cheating, yes, but I'm keeping it cheat-able for fun. Subject
                        to change,
                        if it starts being abused.

                        this is not necessarily universal - it is the choice of the server and the config file of that server
                        to permit global (non-team-only) chat, to allow team-only chat, or to allow chat at all.

                        It is the responsibility of the client to avoid placing in inappropriate areas. Generally speaking most things should
                        only be placed if they are in the 600 pixel box around the castle, and forts/castles should only be placed if they
                        are <i>not</i> within the 600 pixel boundary. Some variation is acceptable, but I will go to war against anyone who makes
                        placing atop castles possible. Seriously, I will never forgive any human being who does that.

                        This is the first non-HELLO non-ping command the client should send to the server. It has no optional arguments.
                        The password is used during team games to separate users into teams; it is also used in private games to keep others out.
                        If there is no password set on the server, then the password sent will have no effect; if there <i>is</i> a password set on the server,
                        and an empty password is sent, the user will become a spectator. Spectators are unable to place castles or move objects.
                        If a user joins an already-running game, password is ignored and they become a spectator. w(1) is sent by the server any time a user becomes
                        a spectator.<br>
                        For example, c(uffit, frog, normal) will join a server with password "uffit" (or no password), as banner "frog", with the default arrangement (castle, 4 fighters).

                        The game is over with a winner. This can be a team banner or a player banner; how the distinction is handled (if at all)
                        is implementation-specific. Cleanup routines should run now; the server will reset itself and disconnect all clients automatically.

                        Every time a physical property of an object changes, this is sent. The server attempts to minimize the number of arguments sent,
                        while maintaining order - so if width or height have changed, all values must be included. X and Y are not optional because
                        the server will not broadcast an unnecessary movement message, and they are always included if something has changed. The
                        order of values is from most common to least common, so the vast majority of move messages sent will be just X and Y.

                        but most configurations will collect money very early. This value should never be touched by the client directly except when initalized,
                        instead, it should wait for S messages to change the score value.

                        New block message. The ID is unique among all blocks, but may be the same as a banner. There is enough data to establish a BBOX of the rotated object;
                        this is necessary for boundary checking when placing a new object. New objects are sent in a big chunk at the start of the game (before metadata is sent),
                        and then all throughout when pieces are placed and bullets are shot. The banner of a piece is the banner it flies under - this is useful for ownership checks
                        in team games, because you can determine what team it belongs to based on the team of the owning client. While team members can't move each other's pieces,
                        it's very useful to know what pieces are friendly (on the team) and which aren't. It is acceptable to show friendly objects (on the same team) on minimaps,
                        even if they are compass-cloaked.

                        This is sent for every frame the server computes, after all movements and other changes have been broadcasted.
                        Clients should only broadcast commands upon ticks; broadcasting changes more often than once per tick is unnecessary
                        and slows down the server. Because this will only be sent about thirty times a second, and most people prefer much higher
                        framerates, you will probably need to do linear interpolation to smooth movement. Comes with an optional health argument, 
                        if you have placed a castle: it is reported in absolute health, not as a percentage, so you will need to divide by 3.

                        t is only sent if the game is actually running; other commands are sent in its place if the game is in a waiting state.
                        It is possible to calculate the amount of time remaining the stage based on the counter. This is implementation-specific.

                <p>
                    Throughout this document, a client's callsign is sometimes referred to as their "banner". This is an ambiguous term; the better term is "banner name".
                    In MMOSG code, banners are actually unique integers referring to a client and everything owned by that client. It is, in effect, a client id. The id is used
                    to index the banner name, which is what you actually <i>see</i> and what is set by the banner argument in the c command.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Banner ids are guaranteed to be unique per game, but they are reset along with the rest of the program when the server resets for a new game.
                    Thus, banners should never be cached between games, but may be relied upon for ownership data and labelling during gameplay. Banners are guaranteed
                    to be immutable - once a banner is assigned, it cannot be changed. Clients should never attempt to recycle or remove banners under any circumstances
                    until the game ends.
                </p>
                <h1 id="types">Types</h1>
                <p>
                    Object types are handled with an identifier UTF-8 character. In the server, types are used to check object collision results; in the clients,
                    they are used for graphics and to inform the server what to place. Some types are editable, meaning they will respond to "m" commands. Not all types can be placed. Here is a table of types in ASCII order:

                    Upgrades are arbitrary properties applied to (or removed from) any object in the game. At the moment they
                    are only ever applied to RTFs. They represent things like minimap cloaking (although somet types don't need the upgrade for that),
                    speed upgrades, gun improvements, etc. They are stored as single characters, usually, but any arbitrary string upgrade is supported.
                    Because how upgrades impact objects is handled by the objects themselves, duplicates for different identifiers may (will) exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clients are responsible for accepting and applying upgrades. Notably, no upgrades will (at the moment) trigger automatic costs,
                    so the client must use the C command to apply those costs itself. For most of the upgrades, the client need not take any action
                    beyond storing. Here's a table of upgrades,
